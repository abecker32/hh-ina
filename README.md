Changing the intracellular sodium concentration of an electrically small cell

The intracellular sodium will be measured between 6mEq/L and 24mEq/L in increments of 2mEq/L.
The extracellular concentration will stay constant at 140mEq/L.
We will stimulate between -70mV and 30mV in increments of 10mV. This will be used to determine the minimum voltage required to yield an action potential (threshold voltage).
